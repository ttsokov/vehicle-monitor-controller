Vehicle-monitor-controller project provides a remote, automated monitoring and control capabilities for vehicles. It handles parameters like engine RPM, fuel consumption and emissions. It consists of several distributed applications:
1. [vehicle-monitor-controller-hw-controller](https://github.com/ttsokov/vehicle-monitor-controller-hw-controller): Application for the low-level hardware module.
2. [vehicle-monitor-controller-hw-proxy](https://github.com/ttsokov/vehicle-monitor-controller-hw-proxy): Proxy application for the hardware module.
3. [vehicle-monitor-controller-backend](https://github.com/ttsokov/vehicle-monitor-controller-backend): Backend application.
